How to run the program on Concordia’s lab computer

:


Step 1: Open Anaconda Navigator



On Concordia's labs, there should already be a Desktop app installed.

Step 2: Click on Jupyter Notebook

Jupiter Notebook should be the second icon that you see. Select “Launch”.



Step 3: Open the folder


The folder name is “472_P1 Report 26589596_29683852_40061450_27725930”



Step 4: Click on the file Main.ipynb




Step 5: Click the run icon that is located under the word "Cell"


Notes about “Main.ipynb”:

“Main.ipynb” contains the same code as “Main.py”. 

However, to run it on Jupiter Main.ipynb was created. 


If you wish to run it on a computer that’s not on the lab, “Main.py” can be used from the terminal. 
However, because the computer labs do not used python 3.8 and used an older version, Jupter needs to be used.  





How to enter coordinates:

The board game is a 10X12 matrix.

When a user wishes to enter a position to place a token, they would enter the X-coordinate followed by the Y-coordinate.

The X-coordinate is any number from 1-10 and the Y-coordinate is any letter from a-l or A-L.

Example of valid coordinates: A7, L8
